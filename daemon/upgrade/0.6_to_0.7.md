# Upgrading 0.6.X to 0.7.X

[[toc]]

## Download Files
To upgrade from v0.6.X first switch the directory where you installed your Daemon. If you followed the installation
guide your Daemon is most likely located in `/srv/daemon`. Then, download and unpack the archive using the
command below.

::: danger
Stop your Daemon process before continuing in order to avoid any issues and ensure everything updates as expected.
``` bash
systemctl stop wings
```
:::

``` bash
curl -L https://github.com/pterodactyl/daemon/releases/download/v0.7.0/daemon.tar.gz | tar --strip-components=1 -xzv
```

Then, update the core dependencies for the Daemon with the following command.

``` bash
npm update --only=production
```

## New dependency
Upon updating from 0.6 to 0.7 you will need to install a dependency so the new unrar feature of the panel works.
The dependency you need to install is:
* `unrar`

### Start the Daemon
Finally, start your daemon up, most likely with the command below.

``` bash
systemctl start wings
```
