# Upgrading 0.7 Series

::: warning Minor Versions Only
**DO NOT** use this guide to upgrade from `0.6.X` to `0.7.X`, it will not work and you will encounter errors afterwards. Please check the [0.6 to 0.7](/daemon/upgrade/0.6_to_0.7.md) upgrade documentation to perform that update.
:::

::: tip
Your servers will not go offline during this process thanks to Docker. Clients will briefly lose connection
to the Daemon from the Panel, but only during the restart phase.
:::

## Download Newest Release
First, ensure you're in the Daemon directory, `/srv/daemon`, before continuing through this process. After you've done
that, run the command below to pull down the latest files and unpack them in the daemon directory.

``` bash
curl -L https://github.com/pterodactyl/daemon/releases/download/v0.7.0/daemon.tar.gz | tar --strip-components=1 -xzv
```

## Update Components
After you've pulled down the latest files the last thing you need to do is run the commands below to update the
components and then restart the daemon.

``` bash
npm update --only=production
systemctl restart wings
```
